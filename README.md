# California Housing Price Prediction

This project utilizes machine learning techniques, specifically linear regression, to predict the prices of houses in California. The dataset used for training and evaluation is the California Housing Dataset.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the median house prices based on various features such as total rooms, population, and others. The model is trained on historical data and then tested for its predictive performance.

## Requirements

To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Matplotlib

You can install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install tensorflow pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/california-housing-price-prediction.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```
cd california-housing-price-prediction
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook `Linear Regression with Real DataSet.ipynb` to see the data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation steps.

4. Adjust the hyperparameters and features as needed for experimentation.
